# school-system-in-C#

It is a simple project in C # on designing a school system that contains an entry interface and a database, and also in it there are the following processes: adding, modifying, deleting and searching student data by academic number and searching in all other tables, including (building - class - division - grades - employees. ...) Also, there is a field for student reports and I created the help field as a ready web page.
